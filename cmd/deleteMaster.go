destroy one of those instances. If there are more than one master, a random
instance will be selected from the masters list.

For example, the following command will list all the AWS resources that would
be destroyed if it wasn't a dry-run:

~ cluster-test deleteMaster --cluster barcelona --dry-run --all`,
	Run: deleteMaster,
