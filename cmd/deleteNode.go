	Short: "Tries to delete a K8S node from the specified cluster",
	Long: `This command will list all the nodes of a given cluster and it will
destroy one of those instances. If there are more than one node, a random
instance will be selected from the nodes list.

For example, the following command will list all the AWS resources that would
be destroyed if it wasn't a dry-run:

~ cluster-test deleteNode --cluster barcelona --dry-run --all`,
	Run: deleteNode,
